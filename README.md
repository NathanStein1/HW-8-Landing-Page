# HW-8-Landing-Page
Author: Nathan Stein


This is my portfolio page. At this time, the github pages does not work. This is because there are multiple pages on this project. However, if run through a compiler, you will be able to click through the pages and see the page and load animations. I used the Swup library to enable the "from the bottom" page turning effect, and spent a lot of time working on the CSS animations to add a feeling of gravity to the elements on the page. It works OK for mobile, however, the grid needs more work. I hope to continue working on this as I feel I could really make this page look very impressive.

Bug fixes: 
1. Starting from 'work.html' breaks the page turn effect. Refreshing on the work.html page also breaks the page turn effect. This has to do with the Swup library. 
2. Refactor for Mobile, especially the project grid.
